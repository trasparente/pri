# Quantum field theory - Wikipedia

- It was between 1928 and 1930 that Jordan, Eugene Wigner, Heisenberg, Pauli, and Enrico Fermi discovered that material particles could also be seen as excited states of quantum fields. Just as photons are excited states of the quantized electromagnetic field, so each type of particle had its corresponding quantum field: an electron field, a proton field, etc.

- QFT naturally incorporated antiparticles in its formalism.

- The development of gauge theory and the completion of the Standard Model in the 1970s led to a renaissance of quantum field theory.

- However, QFT a priori imposes no restriction on the number of dimensions nor the geometry of spacetime.

- In spite of its overwhelming success in particle physics and condensed matter physics, QFT itself lacks a formal mathematical foundation.
