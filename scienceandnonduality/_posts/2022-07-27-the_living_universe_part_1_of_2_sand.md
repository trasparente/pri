# The Living Universe - Part 1 of 2 - SAND

- We are swimming in an ocean of subtle energy of such immense power that it is virtually incomprehensible.
- We are not stuff that abides, but patterns that perpetuate themselves; whirlpools of water in an ever-flowing river.
- From the atomic level to the human scale and in between, we find a capacity for reflection and choice that is fitting for that scale.
- It appears that mind, as manifested by the capacity to make choices, is to some extent inherent in every electron.
- Uncertainty and freedom are built into the very foundations of material existence.
