# The Living Universe - Part 2 of 2 - SAND

- A living universe is intent on growing self-referencing and self-organizing systems within itself at every scale.
- We are agents of self-reflective and creative action who are engaged in a time of great transition and conscious learning.
- A living universe invites us to shift from feelings of indifference, fear, and cynicism to feelings of curiosity, love, awe, and participation.
- If most of the known universe is lifeless, then it has no deeper purpose, meaning—or value. It is only natural, therefore, that we focus on consuming material things to minimize life’s pains and maximize its comforts.
- In a living universe, it is only natural that people would choose simpler ways of living that afford greater time and opportunity for connecting with the aliveness of the world in meaningful relationships, creative expressions, and rewarding experiences in nature.
- As a provisional paradigm, a living systems perspective brings with it a transformed description of our cosmic identity, purpose, meaning, consciousness, and ethics as well as a compassionate concern for sustainable ways of living.
- These are of immeasurable value to humanity as we seek to grow consciously through a time of profound planetary transition and come together to build a promising species-civilization.
