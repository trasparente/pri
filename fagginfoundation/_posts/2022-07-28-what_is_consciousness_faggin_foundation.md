# What is Consciousness? | Faggin Foundation

- The feeling is the carrier of meaning through lived experience.

- Yet, consciousness can also turn toward the self, allowing it to know itself.

- I exist the instant I know that I am, because the “substance” of which I am made is self-reflecting and, in recognizing itself, I become a self. The self-knowing is creative because it leads to the existence of the self.

## Feelings

- Perception and comprehension ride on the feelings of the self.

- "Hard problem of consciousness" is explaining existence and origin of qualia: what something feels like (a feeling).

- Feelings layers:

1. Physical

Perceiving the physical environment inside and outside our body.

2. Emotions

Different layer, usually is the thought or memory of an emotion, we think we feel it, is not lived now.

3. Thoughts

Usually felt as essential information of a thought, not the essence of it. Is a synthetic feeling, not spontaneous, they neither cause nor change real feelings.

4. Spiritual

Subtle and revealing, for example, feeling the deepest sense of existing as an independent and unique self, beyond any doubt.

- The impact of a real feeling may spread to all the other layers of our being, bringing forth other feelings associated.

## Perception, understanding, and comprehension

- Subjective and creative processes.

- Consciousness convert signals to qualia (perception) and from qualia to meaning (comprehension = understand the meaning of perceptions).

- Knowing means having informations.

- Understanding (local) links knowledge in hierarchical levels of meaning within an interpretative context of the self: comprehension (global).

- A quantum of understanding emerges unpredictably, from differentiation (discriminate differences and similarities) and integration (synthesize semantic relationships) in the context of the integrated understandings.

- This integration requires intuition, differentiation and synthesis.
