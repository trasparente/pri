# The fundamental nature of reality | Faggin Foundation

- The visible properties of quantum fields are the identifiable parts of the part-whole.

- Everything that exists must be intrinsically conscious, physical universe evolution reflect and support the semantic evolution of selves.

- Semantic inner reality connect everything from the inside but is invisible from the outside.

- The inner reality can only be perceived by each self within itself. Consciousness then, is another name for the capacity of One – totality of what exists – to know itself and come into being in the same act of knowing itself.

- Ego is that part of the consciousness that is identified with the body. When the body dies it can no longer communicate with the ego's consciousness which is no longer shareable through symbolic communication.

- We are completely free to express the meaning we wish, by using the syntactical laws of the symbols that are the physical laws of the universe in which our body exists.
