# The Nature of Consciousness | Faggin Foundation

- Classical physics assumes the existence of matter, energy, space, and time (MEST).

- Observable properties are derived using mathematical theories founded on relationships between MEST fundamental properties.

- Theories postulates are true without proof.

- Validity of this approach is validated when applying theories to physical phenomenon gives experimentally verifiable predictions.

- We postulate that consciousness is an irreducible property of MEST.

- QFT (best theory) tells us that physical reality is an undivided wholeness.

- Classical approach to separate parts is just an approximation to produce a simpler model of reality.

- In QFT the fundamental entities are the quantum fields, and elementary particles are excited states of these.

- A particle appears localized in space-time when his filed interact with another field and is observed.

- The physical world is interacting fields in hierarchical organizations of states.

- Reality to be classical may give us a sense of control but it's false.

- Consciousness is a fundamental property of the quantum fields.

- Living cells are quantum systems.

- Consciousness units (CU) are fundamental fields with an outer symbolic reality (informational, quantum field) and an inner semantic reality (conscious self with identity, free will, and the capacity for action).
