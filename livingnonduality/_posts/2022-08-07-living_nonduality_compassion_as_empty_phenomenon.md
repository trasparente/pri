# Living Nonduality - Compassion as Empty Phenomenon

- the dualistic perception and its labeling process, creating relative conditions, is a product of the egoic mind.
- No reality exists in phenomena, including the separate person (and its consequent intentions).
- Any apparent relative conditions cannot be separated from emptiness.
- The subject/object relationship is realized as false when not tainted by the subject/object perspective, such as “your suffering”/”my compassion.”
- To apply the absolute view is to experience the relative truth in a transcendent way.
