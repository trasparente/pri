- the mechanism of forgetting is the same mechanism of dissociation. forgetting is an instance of dissociation.

- Dissociation is a hierarchical process, it keeps on dissociating within the human mind. Is coherent to think this way.

- But why don't we see a corresponding appearance? You would expect that the rest of the hierarchy would also have an appearance. Maybe evolutionary speaking our cognitive apparatus didn't evolse to pick up the rest of the hierarchy, doesn't have a bearing on our survival.

- In the field of mind there is a complex interplay of multiple levels of dissociation and multiple shifts of the lens of metacognition.

- Deep psychedelic states are profoundly transpersonal.

- For everything ultimately, individual are the carriers of whatever evidence. Whatever reasoning, whatever we come up with as a story to make sense of nature can be discarded. Why don't we do that.

- Epistemically we evolve as individuals and as a culture. Our ability to make a sense of what's going on increases over time.

- In the world in which we evolved, air was everywhere so we don't pick it up. It's irrelevant, it's an invariant in the game of life.

- I don't know and we cannot know for sure, but we can speculate with education.

- What's timeless, isn't static and it isn't dynamic, it's outside time.

- You only experience changes of states of your nervous system (the jellyfish). That's what is empirically correlated with experience.

- Evolution has favored that this colony of other cells (skin, fat, muscle, bones) would grow around what we actually are,which is represented by a nervous system, because it was good for both.

- Cancer is the representation of dissociation where it shouldn't be happening.

- To say that Mal (mind at large) is outside change, does not mean that it doesn't change: the concept of change is not applicable to it (number 5 is married or not?).

- There is something unspeakable, unvisualizable, about mal, that when represented on the dashboard, becomes what we call change.

- That representation is accurate, it does represent something real about mal, yet the movements of the needle in the dial is incommensurable with the actual air pressure variation outside the plane.

- For everything to function you end up needing the whole of the universe.

- Nobody gains from the dysfunction of unchecked empathy.

- You have to learn how to be a jerk.
