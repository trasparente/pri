# Donald Hoffman: Reality is an Illusion - How Evolution Hid the Truth | Lex Fridman Podcast #293 - YouTube

- Questioning the fabric of reality can lead you to either madness or the truth and the funny thing is you won't know which is which.

- What we're seeing is what we need to see to stay alive long enough to reproduce.

- Fitness beats truth and fitness does not have to be connected to truth.

- What evolution gave us was perceptions that guide adaptive behavior and part of that process it turns out means hiding the truth.

- Space-time is doomed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and 10 to the minus 43 seconds, beyond that space-time doesn't even make sense it just has no operational definition.

- There's all this beautiful real estate that's just smiling and waving at us and we can never get to it.

- My attitude as a scientist is I don't believe any of our theories.

- The distinction that we make between living and non-living is not a fundamental distinction it's an artifact of the limits of our interface.

- Now we've discovered space-time itself is doomed, quarks leptons and gluons are just irreducible representations of the symmetries of space-time.

- I presume human consciousness is a tiny drop in the bucket of the infinite variety of consciousnesses.

- In my fundamental definition of a conscious age there are only experiences and probabilistic relationships that of how they trigger other experiences.

- Right now i have no neurons.

- Consciousness creates the brain not the brain creates consciousness.

- In a stationary Markovian dynamics there is some entropy but it's constant so there's no increasing entropy and in that sense the dynamics is timeless, there is no entropic time.

- Then i read these spiritual traditions and realize they're saying very very similar things it's like there's a lot of conversions.

- Almost all the mind stuff that's going on in my head is about attachment to the interface.

- Essentially the only way to really detach from the interface is to literally let go of thoughts altogether, even my identity, my whole history, my name, my education, all this stuff is almost irrelevant because it's just now, the present moment.

- So i'm always lost in the game unless i literally consciously choose to stop thinking.

- To look beyond the game it scares the hell out of me, it really is scary, because i'm so attached to this body, i'm attached to the interface.

- So we know from quantum theory that the act of observation is an act of fact creation.

- When I sit there and say okay I am not something in space and time, then something inside of me says you're crazy, of course you are, and i'm completely attached to all this stuff.

-  I spend a lot more time looking at what spiritual traditions say, I take it all with a grain of salt but on the other hand i think it's stupid for me to ignore it, so i try to listen to the best ideas and to sort out nonsense from it.

- I think the closest way to think about god is being, not a being but being.

- Waking up to who you really are outside of space and time as the author of space and time, the author of everything that you see and space and time is just one little data structure.
