# Rupert Spira on Non-Dualism, Consciousness, God, and Death - YouTube

- 1:20:37 In order to say, I know that I am finite, that which knows that finitude, cannot itself be finite.
- 1:28:24 That's what the ego (separate person) is: the appearance, and the corresponding feeling of being separate, temporary and finite.
- I would suggest that was an illusion, that separation is an illusion. And is the cause of suffering on the inside, and conflict on the outside.
- 1:29:14 I would suggest that what we as human beings called the experience of happiness, is the nature of consciousness.

## Happiness and separation

- 1:29:40 The nature of consciousness is what we call peace or happiness.
- Now, we apparently separate, localized finite minds are a fragment, or an apparent fragment of consciousness.
- We are a finite mind, and believing ourselves to be temporary and finite, we no longer feel ourselves in Consciousness, when we no longer feel the nature of consciousness, which is happiness.
- So this apparent collapse of consciousness into a finite mind, entails the overlooking of its innate peace and happiness.
- And that is why the finite mind or the separate self, feels that it is a fragment, it is incomplete, that it needs to be completed.
- And it seeks objective experience that is objects, substances, activities, relationships, in order to complete itself.
- It doesn't really want the object. What it really wants is to be divested of its sense of separation, and thus returned to its natural state of wholeness, which, from a human perspective, is conceptualized as happiness.
